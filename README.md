# Data-Warehouse-for-University
Data Warehouse created for University.The main goal of the university is to achieve the highest possible
number of students with available resources. To achieve this goal, the
dean wants to increase the number of students in the next year by 5%.
Because of that Gdansk University of Technology will monitor two
metrics: number of students at the whole university and at each
department after the start of each semester. The university is considered
successful when there is a rising trend for both metrics at a level not
lower than 2.5% per semester.
